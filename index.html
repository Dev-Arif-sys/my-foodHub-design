         <h3>Anticuchos</h3>
         <p>Anticuchos are skewers of meat or grilled beef heart. Although they don’t sound very interesting and much less delicious, the truth is actually the opposite. This dish can be found in both luxury restaurants and on street stalls.</p>

                <h3>Bicol Express</h3>
                <p>Bicol Express is a popular Filipino dish in which the slices of pork meat is cooked with coconut milk, shrimp paste, and chili pepper. There’s a belief that this dish was adapted from a Bicolano recipe called “Gulay na may Lada,” meaning ‘vegetable with chili.’</p>
